## Project Summary

This system will provide an interface for tracking airline flight statuses, schedules, and passenger information. It will help airlines, passengers, and ground services to keep track of flights, cancellations, delays, and other important details. By organizing the data in an easy-to-access manner, it will improve communication between airline staff and customers, streamline operational procedures, and enhance overall efficiency.

## Problem Statement:
Managing flight data, including schedules, cancellations, and flight statuses, can be challenging for airlines due to the large volume of real-time data. Additionally, passengers and airline personnel need a quick and reliable way to access flight information to ensure smooth operations. Currently, many airlines and travel services do not have an integrated, user-friendly solution for tracking and updating flight statuses or managing passenger records efficiently.
The problem is the lack of a centralized database system that can store, track, and update this data effectively for various stakeholders (airlines, passengers, staff). The existing systems might be hard to navigate.
